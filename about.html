      <h3>Pros and cons</h3>
      <div class="pro">
        <h4>Pros</h4>
        <p><b>Lightweight</b> 
          <br>With core tools, non-multilib libraries, OpenRC are installed in the system, we focus more on system size and speed for experienced and advanced users. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Fast</b> 
          <br>Hanh Linux uses <i>pacman</i> as the main package manager. <i>pacman</i> installs compiled packages instead downloads packages' source code and compiles them on your computer. This will save your time when upgrading and installing new packages.
          <br>Also, OpenRC only mounts important filesystems and starts services. systemd controls everything in the system, even your money and time to solve the problem when it is broken.
          <br>
          <b>Customizable</b>
          <br>The installer give you chance to select, remove pre-installed packages (including installer) and install Xorg (no DE/WM install support). We also clean everything that the installer provides but you don't need to use.
          <br>Also, there some packages will give you source code only if you want to compile yourself like <i>linux-src</i>
          <br>
          <b>Packages</b>
          <br>We use Arch, Artix and our mirrors to help you access more packages. Also, AUR is a great place for you if you want to install some unofficial packages.
        </p>

      <div class="cons">
        <h4>Cons</h4>
        <p>
          <b>Experience</b>
          <br>Even that we have the installer, it still requires some manual work like typing, working with <i>fdisk</i>, etc.
          <br>If you want to remove pre-installed packages in the system, you must be careful that your system may unbootable because of what you select
          <br>
          <b>Limited packages</b>
          <br>Since we uses non-multilib and only some languages for core libraries in the system, some packages may not work properly. 
          <br>You need to install the Artix <i>gcc-libs</i> and <i>glibc</i>, also <i>gcc</i> for compling.
          <br>
          <b>Rolling releases</b>
          <br><i>pacman </i>installs the newewst packages available in the repositories. That means if you installs some packages are released for a short time, your system may break
